Approximate change log for COMSERV by version

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4.3 :

  * Implement a power of 2 backoff and retry for failing connections
    with a maximum 10 minute wait.  This keeps from filling up the
    logs with failed repeated attempts.


Version 1.4.2 :

  * Better error handling when the local tcp/ip port is already in use


Version 1.4.1 :

  * Fixes for serving local serial ports


Version 1.4.0 :

  * Add the ability to serve up local serial ports to remote
    processes, effectively turning the system running comservd into a
    terminal server


Version 1.3.6 :

  * Allow setting of global default options in the config file


Version 1.3.6 :

  * Increase the size of the pty name-space that we check


Version 1.3.4 :

  * Fixes for non-blocking connects


Version 1.3.3 :

  * Enhanced status update

  * Use non-blocking socket connects so that we don't get held up by a
    terminal server that is down


Version 1.3.2 :

  * Throttle back the rate of connections when starting up - some old
    Xyplexes crash if you connect to them too quickly

  * Allow CTRL-b to send a break character


Version 1.3.1 :

  * Add default device directory, default log directory directive

  * Add daemon restart capability via a command or SIGHUP

    transmitter if the reciever is not listening

  * Add ability to see the buffered data of a session

  * Better buffering

  * Periodic retry of failed connections

  * Add ability to use an alternate config file

  * Manual page updates

    scripts
